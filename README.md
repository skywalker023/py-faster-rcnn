* This is the server code running Faster-RCNN.
* We built a Korean food image dataset with 41 classes(40 + background).

Installation instructions will be on Girshick's original code.
I added some post-processing code and visualizing tools for custom inputs.

In order to use this code, you must have your dataset as the same format with Pascal VOC.
